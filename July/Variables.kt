//    Kotlin: Type mismatch: inferred type is String but Int was expected
//    we have two type of variables that is chaneable and not changeable that is mutable(var) and immutable(val)
//    varibale names can cobtain letters,numbers and undercoress
//    names must start with a letter or an underscore names can be anything except kotlin keywords
//            camelCase is prefered for naming
